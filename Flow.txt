Absolutely. This is a great question, and if you explain this flow clearly, it shows you understand the system end-to-end, not just React.

I’ll walk you through the complete finished project flow, step by step — user flow + backend flow together.

🌐 OVERALL FINISHED PROJECT FLOW

API Registration Portal (End-to-End)


---

1️⃣ User Registration (Signup)

User Workflow

User opens the portal

Fills signup form

Submits details


Backend Workflow

Backend receives signup request

Validates input

Hashes password

Saves user with role = USER

Account status = PENDING / ACTIVE


✔️ Admin role is not assigned here


---

2️⃣ User Login

User Workflow

User logs in with email & password


Backend Workflow

Verifies credentials

Generates JWT token

Sends:

Token

Role

User ID



Frontend stores token securely


---

3️⃣ Role-Based Redirection (UI)

Frontend Workflow

Reads role from backend response

Redirects:

USER → User Dashboard

ADMIN → Admin Dashboard



(No decision is trusted beyond UI here)


---

4️⃣ API Access Request (User)

User Workflow

User selects an API

Fills request form:

Purpose

Duration

Environment


Submits request


Backend Workflow

Validates token

Confirms role = USER

Saves request:

Status = PENDING

Linked to user




---

5️⃣ Admin Review & Approval

Admin Workflow

Admin logs in

Views pending API requests

Reviews details

Approves or rejects


Backend Workflow

Verifies admin token

Updates request status

If approved → proceeds to key generation



---

6️⃣ API Key Generation & Registration

Backend Workflow

Generates:

API Key

Client ID / Secret


Registers key:

User

API

Permissions

Validity


Stores securely



---

7️⃣ User Views API Credentials

User Workflow

User sees:

Approved APIs

API keys

Usage details



Backend Workflow

Sends masked key details

Enforces access limits



---

8️⃣ Using the API (Outside Portal)

User Workflow

User calls API with key/token


Backend Workflow

Validates API key

Checks:

Validity

Rate limit

Permissions


Allows or denies request



---

9️⃣ Monitoring & Management (Admin)

Admin Workflow

View usage logs

Disable / regenerate keys

Revoke access


Backend Workflow

Logs requests

Applies throttling

Updates key status



---

🔁 COMPLETE FLOW (One-Line Diagram)

Signup → Login → Request API → Admin Approval → Key Generation → API Usage → Monitoring


---

🧠 WHO DOES WHAT (Final Summary)

Layer	Responsibility

Frontend (React)	UI, forms, routing, dashboards
Backend	Auth, roles, approval, key generation
Database	Users, requests, keys, logs
Security	JWT, role checks, rate limiting



---

🎓 How You Explain This in Presentation (Perfect Line)

> “The frontend manages user interaction and role-based navigation, while the backend handles authentication, authorization, approval workflows, and secure API key management.”
